#BOOKINGDOTIN – A movie booking application
1.	Introduction
The Cinema Booking Web Application is imagined to offer both users and administrators a seamless and effective platform for browsing and subsequently booking movie tickets online. Using a mix of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js— which is called MERN stack. This application gives a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface to its end-users and administrators. It provides easy registration and logging in to the created accounts, movie searches currently shown, selection of preferred theaters and showtimes, and secure ticket booking, and engages in a strong back-end that efficiently manages user data, movie details, showtimes, and ticket bookings. For administrators, it offers comprehensive tools to manage movie listings, schedule showtimes, and view theater operations. Cinema Booking Web Application has easy navigation and makes the ticket-booking process hassle-free for any movie-goer, combined with secure payment methods and real-time seat availability updates. A wide range of research and planning for the development of this application was carried out based on user choices and technical requirements for a robust, scalable, and secure solution in cinema management.

2.	Research and Planning
Initially, it all started with research and extensive planning to ensure that the objectives set for this development of a web application for cinema ticket booking were effectively met. Detailed market research had to be conducted on current leading cinema booking systems, handling Fandango, BookMyShow, and AMC Theatres, to examine their popular features, functionalities, and enhancements in the user interface. This is followed by visits to and investigation of potential users to gain valuable insights into their needs and wants, mostly dwelling on several peculiar features, such as ease of navigation, secure payment portals, and current seat availability.
A technical feasibility study was used to decide on the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, to ensure efficient, scalable, and fully integrated front-end and back-end development. The system architecture has been properly designed in a way that aids robustness and scalability, which includes elaborate documentation of the database schema and diagrams, user flows, and component hierarchies. API endpoints were also envisioned to enable smooth communication between the client and server. 
3.	Technology Used
The Cinema Booking Web Application uses a blend of the latest Web Technologies to deliver a firm yet efficient experience to the user. An overview of the technologies used is as follows
3.1 Frontend:
•	React.js: JavaScript library used for building user interfaces; used for creating dynamic, responsive components
•	Redux: State management library for JavaScript apps; used for managing the application state.
•	React Router: A standard library for routing in React, helps in navigation among the different views of the application.
•	Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests against the backend API.
3.2 Backend:
•	Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that helps one run server-side code.
•	Express.js: Node.js web application framework to build the backend API.
•	MongoDB: This is a NoSQL database that will be used for storing application data. The flexibility of MongoDB makes it very efficient in handling different types of data.
•	Mongoose: Part of the ODM library that bridges MongoDB with Node.js, providing an easy schema-based solution to modeling the application data.
3.3 Authentication:
•	JWT (JSON Web Token): Used in safe user authentication, to ensure that only authenticated users have access to specific areas of the application.
3.4 Deployment:
•	Render: A cloud platform used for the deployment of the web application. It offers seamless deployment and scale features.
3.5 Other Tools
•	Git and GitHub: Used for version control and collaboration.
•	ESLint and Prettier: These tools are used for code linting and formatting respectively, to ensure that the codebase remains clean and consistent.
•	Postman: Basically for testing API endpoints.
